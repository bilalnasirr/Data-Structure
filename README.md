# Data-Structure
This project is about Memory Efficient Doubly Linked List which is not possible in python due to no memory access. We tried to show this code by
 simulating the address ids. This code can be done in a better way using cpython. This code contains different functions of memory efficient doubly linked list such as insert,delete,print.
